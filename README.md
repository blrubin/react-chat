This simple chat app is my first project using React. Here’s what I’m using:  

	React 
	Babel 
	Webpack
	Socket.io 
	ESLint 

I started following [this tutorial](https://www.coderfactoryacademy.edu.au/posts/how-you-can-build-facebook-messenger-chat-app-with-reactjs) and then added the following functionality:

	• Time stamps - when a user sends a message, the current time is added to the message object and displayed beside the message on hover
	• User list - a list of all active users at the current time. The user list updates whenever a user joins or leaves the chat

To start the app:

	npm install
	npm run dev
